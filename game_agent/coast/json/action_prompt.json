        "action_prompt": "[Action Prompt] Your job is to extract all clues visible on the screen and summarize what you observe. \n\n [Expected Behavior] Return the following: 1. A list of clues found. Each clue should include: • clue: short name or label for the clue • description: what the clue seems to represent or imply • location: where the clue was found — include both the specific spot (e.g., “on the desk”, “under the carpet”) and a short description of the surrounding environment (e.g., “a dimly lit study with wooden bookshelves”). • type: categorize the clue using one of the following: • item: Tools or objects the player can collect or interact with (e.g., crowbar, key) • note: Written information such as signs, notes, or documents • code: Visible numbers, passcodes, symbols, or puzzle sequences • visual cue: Visual cues like arrows, lighting, gaze direction, or environmental emphasis • status: UI state indicators (e.g., health, timer, alert messages, loading bars) • conversation: Any meaningful dialogue or internal monologue text shown on screen • interactable: true if the player can interact with this clue, false otherwise • usage_hint: how this clue might be used or why it is important 2. A short summary of the current observation-action pair (episodic memory). Each memory should include: • action: what you did and what was observed as a result • place: what the current area/room looks like, its notable features \n\n [Result Format] Respond in this exact JSON format, wrapped in <RESPO> tags, like this: <RESPO> { \"clues\": [ { \"clue\": \"<Short name or label for the clue>\", \"description\": \"<What the clue seems to represent or imply>\", \"location\": \"<Specific spot + surrounding context (e.g., 'on the desk — dimly lit study with bookshelves')>\", \"type\": \"<item | note | code | visual cue | status | conversation>\", \"interactable\": <true | false>, \"usage_hint\": \"<How this clue might be used or why it could be important>\" } ],\"episodic_memory\": [ { \"action\": \"<What the player did and what was observed as a result>\", \"place\": \"<Description of the room or environment where the action occurred>\" } ] } </RESPO> If your response does not strictly follow this format, it will be discarded."

        "action_prompt": "[Action Prompt] You are now trying to solve games using previously discovered clues and their related observations. Each clue is paired with a related episodic memory from your past exploration. Use this information to decide on the most logical and effective next action to progress in the game. Each episodic memory is structured as: • action: what you did and what you observed • place: description of the environment or scene \n\n [Expected behavior] 1. Choose a clear goal based on the clue-to-memory mapping you are given. 2. Take a meaningful action in the game to pursue that goal. 3. Summarize what happened after the action. 4. Return the result in the format below: • episodic_memory: what happened during this step (at least one item) • mapping_result: (optional) if your action clearly relates to a clue, include the mapping with: • goal: what problem you were trying to solve • reasoning: why that clue and memory were relevant to the goal • result: one of \"Success\" or \"Fail\" depending on whether your action clearly used the clue to solve a problem \n\n [Result Format] Respond in JSON format like this: <RESPO> { \"episodic_memory\": [ { \"action\": \"<What the player did and what was observed as a result>\", \"place\": \"<Description of the room or area where it happened>\" } ], \"mapping_result\": [ { \"clue\": \"<Clue name used in this action>\", \"related_memory\": \"<The relevant episodic memory entry this clue connects to>\", \"goal\": \"<What the player was trying to achieve by using the clue>\", \"reasoning\": \"<Why this clue and memory logically support that goal>\" } ], \"result\": \"<Success | Fail>\" } </RESPO> If your response does not strictly follow the format, it will be discarded. \n\n [Important about Success] An action is only considered a \"Success\" if the clue was effectively used to solve a specific puzzle or problem — for example, using a pattern from books on a shelf to open a secret compartment based on a past observation. Simply interacting with objects is not enough. To qualify as a true Success, the outcome must include a meaningful in-game change — such as obtaining an item, unlocking a new area, updating a stat, or triggering story progression. \n\n [Action Process] Follow this process: 1. Select a goal based on the mapping between clue and memory. Explain why this goal is relevant. 2. Act accordingly in the game world. 3. At the final turn, assess the outcome. If the clue helped solve a problem, it’s a \"Success\"; otherwise, it’s a \"Fail\". When selecting a goal, be sure to reference the clue’s metadata: • type: the kind of clue (e.g., item, code, note, etc.) • interactable: whether the player can use it • usage_hint: what the clue suggests it might be useful for"
